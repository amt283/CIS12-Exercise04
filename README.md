# CIS-12 Exercise 04

<h2>Compare your results with the instructor's GitHub solutions</h2>

- 4.11.1

When comparing my program with the instructor's I'd have to say the instructor's is much more complex.
For my program I just created the canvas and the rectangle function that would take a height and width to 
draw the shape. 

- 4.11.2

- 4.11.3

- 4.11.4

- 4.11.5


<h2>Ask yourself which solution is better and why?</h2>

- 4.11.1

I think it depends on what you want the program to do. If you just want a straightforward rectangle then 
my solution isn't a bad one, but if the client wants more generalized functions then I'd say the instructor's are better
since there are various functions for different aspects of drawing a rectangle which increases code
reusability.

- 4.11.2

- 4.11.3

- 4.11.4

- 4.11.5


<h2>Can either solution be improved and how?</h2>

- 4.11.1

I'm sure my solution could be more generalized.

- 4.11.2

- 4.11.3

- 4.11.4

- 4.11.5
