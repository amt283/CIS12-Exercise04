# CIS-12 Exercise 04

<h2>Compare your results with the instructor's GitHub solutions</h2>

- 4.11.1

When comparing my program with the instructor's I'd have to say the instructor's is much more complex but the video
does acknowledge that there were quite a few functions from the book that never got used, such as jump, so I'd say
they balance out.

For my program I just created the canvas and the rectangle function that would take a height and width to 
draw the shape which more or less matched what polyline() was doing.

- 4.11.2

This is a similar situation to 4.11.1 where the instructor's code is much more streamlined and efficient and I can see 
how that would be incredibly useful depending on what needs to be done with the program. I think it gives the 
programmers much more flexibility to make the program do a wider variety of tasks with the least amount of code 
possible.

- 4.11.3

Similar situation as 4.11.2

- 4.11.4

- 4.11.5


<h2>Ask yourself which solution is better and why?</h2>

- 4.11.1

I think it depends on what you want the program to do. If you just want a straightforward rectangle then 
my solution isn't a bad one, but if the client wants more generalized functions then I'd say the instructor's are better
since there are various functions for different aspects of drawing a rectangle which increases code
reusability.

- 4.11.2

Same situation as 4.11.1. I took a crack at the exercises before I watched the Exercise 04 
video so I could see how the two solutions differed, so I think the instructor's code is much better and much more 
streamlined. Not only that but the code is much more compartmentalized so code can be reused for a wider variety of 
tasks compared to a program that is only capable of making "rectangles" and "rhombuses"

- 4.11.3

Similar situation as 4.11.1 and 4.11.2

- 4.11.4

- 4.11.5


<h2>Can either solution be improved and how?</h2>

- 4.11.1

I'm sure my solution could be more generalized so if someone just wants two lines, for example, they could easily use 
a function that's designed just for that and I could use that function in the rectangle() to create the shape.

- 4.11.2

I definitely think my solution could be improved by following the instructor's example and generalizing the functions
even further.

- 4.11.3

Similar situation as 4.11.1 and 4.11.2

- 4.11.4

- 4.11.5
